      <b>I have a great idea for a Pixar movie.  Can I send it to you?</b> <br />
      <p>Pixar does not accept any kind of creative submission. All of Pixar’s ideas and stories are developed internally and it is our policy not to look at any external submissions. For legal reasons we do not consider any creative material (scripts, synopses, sketches, etc.) sent to us unsolicited. Please see our website Terms of Use for more information.</p><br />
      <b>When was Pixar established?</b><br />
      <p>Pixar was established on February 3, 1986.</p> <br />
      <b>Can the public tour the Pixar facility?</b> <br />
      <p>Due to production demands and confidentiality issues, we are a closed studio and do not offer tours.</p> <br />
      <b>I am working on a school project. Can I interview someone from Pixar or will you please send me materials that I can use as part of a presentation?</b> <br />
      <p>We receive a large number of requests for information in connection with student projects; unfortunately, we are not able to respond to each one individually. This website, however, contains answers to many of the most commonly asked questions about Pixar, our employees, the work that is done at our studio, and information about the animation industry as a whole.</p> <br />
      <b>What is Pixar's policy or practice for donations, scholarships, or charities?</b> <br />
      <p>Pixar's charitable giving supports local charitable organizations and schools that directly focus on the under-represented in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics (STEAM). </p> <br />
      <p>We receive many requests for donations that meet these criteria and take a great deal of care in determining which initiatives to support. Regrettably, we are not able to accommodate all of the worthy requests we receive or requests that fall outside of our mission. </p> <br />
      <p>Pixar does not have a scholarship program at this time. </p> <br />
      <b>Where do I ask a general investor question about The Walt Disney Company?</b> <br />
